      Through the by keyword, the Kotlin compiler does automatically what you did manually in the previous version of the code. Compare this code
         to the previous version of the Person class: the generated code when you use delegated properties is very similar. The object to the right of by is called the delegate. Kotlin automatically stores the delegate in a hidden property and calls getValue and setValue on the delegate when you access or modify the main property.",

      The lazy function returns an object that has a method called getValue with the proper signature, so you can use it together with the by keyword to create a delegated property. The argument of lazy is a lambda that it calls to initialize the value. The lazy function is thread-safe by default; and if you need to, you can specify additional options to tell it which lock to use or
         to bypass the synchronization entirely if the class is never used in a multithreaded environment.",

Follow these steps when completing a headroom calculation:

1. Identify major components.

2. Assign responsibility for determining actual usage and maximum capacity.

3. Determine intrinsic or natural growth.

4. Determine business activity–based growth.

5. Determine peak seasonality effects.

6. Estimate headroom or capacity reclaimed by infrastructure projects.

7. Perform the headroom calculation:

• If the result is positive, you have sufficient capacity for the time frame analyzed.

• If the result is negative, you do not have sufficient capacity over the specified time frame.

It meant technology architecture, yes. It also meant team structure. It meant understanding the underpinnings of the business and the directions in which it was headed. I like to describe technology strategy for product-focused companies as something that “enables the many potential futures of the business.” It’s not just a reactive document that tries to account for current problems, but it anticipates and enables future growth. If you’re in a product-focused business, this is the heart of your technology strategy. It’s not about actually deciding the product’s direction, but about enabling the larger roadmap to play out successfully.",

So what you’ll need to do is set up a separate analysis—a separate SonarQube project—for each language. This means that you’ll have a SonarQube Runner properties file for each language, and you’ll run an analysis for each properties file. (Maven folks, you’ll still run your primary analysis through Maven, but you’ll want to use SonarQube Runner for the rest.)",

PR duration —If a PR was good, it should get merged within the day. If it needed a slight tweak, then maybe it would get fixed and merged the day after it was originally submitted.

Because a local Couchbase Lite database is often synchronized with a remote database through the Couchbase Sync Gateway, which is covered in Chapter 16, it’s possible that while your code is updating a document, the background replication process has already downloaded a newer version of the same document. If a newer revision of a document exists, the putProperties method simply returns an error, which you must handle in code. Most likely, you’ll have to write some sort of update-with-retry logic, similar to what you’ve seen in Chapter 4 with CAS and optimistic concurrency.

teams and SRE teams, given that they are generally evaluated on different
metrics. Product development performance is largely evaluated on
product velocity, which creates an incentive to push new code as quickly as
possible. Meanwhile, SRE performance is (unsurprisingly) evaluated based upon reliability
of a service, which implies an incentive to push back against a high rate of
change. Information asymmetry between the two teams further amplifies this
inherent tension.  The product developers have more visibility into the time
and effort involved in writing and releasing their code, while the SREs have more
visibility into the service’s reliability (a...",

On this OS we run something called a hypervisor, which has two key jobs. First, it maps resources like CPU and memory from the virtual host to the physical host.
