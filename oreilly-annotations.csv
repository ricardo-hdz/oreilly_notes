So far, we’ve spoken about patterns to help work with shared databases, and hopefully move on to less coupled models. In a moment, we need to look in detail at patterns around database decomposition. Before we do that, though, we need to discuss sequencing. Extracting a microservice isn’t “done” until the application code is running in its own service, and the data it controls is extracted into its own logically isolated database. But with this being a book largely about enabling incremental change, we have to explore a little how this extraction should be sequenced. We have a few options:

Split the database first, then the code.

Split the code first, then the database.

Split them both at once.",

With change data capture, rather than trying to intercept and act on calls made into the monolith, we react to changes made in a datastore. For change data capture to work, the underlying capture system has to be coupled to the monolith’s datastore. That’s really an unavoidable challenge with this pattern.",

By breaking our processing into individual microservices, these processes can be scaled independently. This means we can also hopefully cost-effectively scale—we need to scale up only those parts of our processing that are currently constraining our ability to handle load.

Pods are comprised of one or more containers working together symbiotically. To create a Pod, you write a Pod manifest and submit it to the Kubernetes API server by using the command-line tool or (less frequently) by making HTTP and JSON calls to the server directly.

Once you’ve submitted the manifest to the API server, the Kubernetes scheduler finds a machine where the Pod can fit and schedules the Pod to that machine. Once scheduled, the kubelet daemon on that machine is responsible for creating the containers that correspond to the Pod, as well as performing any health checks defined in the Pod manifest.

Once a Pod is scheduled to a node, no rescheduling occurs if that node fails. Additionally, to create multiple replicas of the same Pod you have to create and name them manually.",

         hold intermediate results of the processing.

Lower priority than default and meant to be used for utility-type operations, such as downloading a book or video, within an application that are still user-facing.

This makes schedule and cost predictions actually a weak metric for risk management – we are better off if we can create leading indicators. In my experience, you create such leading indicators by having your symptom list consist of statements about off‐nominal technical and engineering properties, rather than statements about adverse schedule or cost impact.

It meant technology architecture, yes. It also meant team structure. It meant understanding the underpinnings of the business and the directions in which it was headed. I like to describe technology strategy for product-focused companies as something that “enables the many potential futures of the business.” It’s not just a reactive document that tries to account for current problems, but it anticipates and enables future growth. If you’re in a product-focused business, this is the heart of your technology strategy. It’s not about actually deciding the product’s direction, but about enabling the larger roadmap to play out successfully.",

According to the definition of the bitwise XOR operation, it gets 1 when two input bits are different and gets 0 when they are same. Therefore, the result of XOR indicates the bit difference between m and n. For example, the XOR result of 1010 and 1101 is 0111. Three bits are different between these two numbers, and there are three 1 bits in their XOR result.

After we get the XOR result, the remaining task is to count 1s in a number that has been discussed already",

If an interview problem has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, it might be solved by dynamic programming.

The ingredient optimal substructure means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by a combination of optimal solutions to its subproblems. Therefore, the first step to utilize dynamic programming is to check whether the problem exhibits such optimal substructures.",

It is suitable for scenarios where there is a set of options available at each step, and we must choose one from these. After a choice is made, there is a new set of options for the next step. This procedure is repeated over and over until we reach a final state.

Conceptually, all options compose a tree structure. Leaves in the tree correspond to solution states, some of which might be the final acceptable state, but others might not. The backtracking algorithm traverses this tree recursively, from the root down and in depth-first order.",

A PQ maintains a collection of items, each of which has an associated integer priority that represents the importance of an item. A PQ allows one to insert an item, x, with its associated priority, p. Lower values of p represent items of higher importance. The fundamental operation of a PQ is getMin, which returns the item in PQ whose priority value is lowest (or in other words, is the most important item). Another operation, decreasePriority, may be provided by a PQ that allows us to locate a specific item in the PQ and reduce its associated priority value (which increases its importance) while leaving the item in the PQ.",

High number of comments —They saw that if a PR had more than six comments it was an indication that it was getting tossed around too much. If they saw comments going up, they should investigate to find out why a solution was so controversial.
PR duration —If a PR was good, it should get merged within the day. If it needed a slight tweak, then maybe it would get fixed and merged the day after it was originally submitted. PRs open for multiple days indicated there was a problem somewhere; either the team didn’t agree on the technical implementation and they were spinning on the best solution or for some reason no one was reviewing, approving, or merging the PRs.",

Because a local Couchbase Lite database is often synchronized with a remote database through the Couchbase Sync Gateway, which is covered in Chapter 16, it’s possible that while your code is updating a document, the background replication process has already downloaded a newer version of the same document. If a newer revision of a document exists, the putProperties method simply returns an error, which you must handle in code. Most likely, you’ll have to write some sort of update-with-retry logic, similar to what you’ve seen in Chapter 4 with CAS and optimistic concurrency. The update method, on the other hand, already contains the retry logic. When a conflict is detected, update calls itself recursively with the newest revision of the document, until there is no longer a conflict. Within the update method, your callback code performs the conflict resolution, possibly several times if the document is changing rapidly in the background.",

teams and SRE teams, given that they are generally evaluated on different
metrics. Product development performance is largely evaluated on
product velocity, which creates an incentive to push new code as quickly as
possible. Meanwhile, SRE performance is (unsurprisingly) evaluated based upon reliability
of a service, which implies an incentive to push back against a high rate of
change. Information asymmetry between the two teams further amplifies this
inherent tension.  The product developers have more visibility into the time
and effort involved in writing and releasing their code, while the SREs have more
visibility into the service’s reliability (and the state of production in
general).",

Matrix-oriented organizations attempt to combine functional and market orientation. However, as many who work in or manage matrix organizations observe, matrix organizations often result in complicated organizational structures, such as individual contributors reporting to two managers or more, and sometimes achieving neither of the goals of functional or market orientation.
Market-oriented organizations optimize for responding quickly to customer needs.
